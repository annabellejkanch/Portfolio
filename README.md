# Machine Learning

| Project Name  |     Tools     | Project Overview |   Timeline |
| ------------- | ------------- |   -------------  |  -------------   |
|[MISO Analysis](https://github.com/annabellejkanch/MISO-Analysis) | Python, SQL   |${{\color{Green}\{\textsf{  Topic: Energy Market Analysis \ \}}}}\$ &rarr;                  | Aug 2022 - Nov 2022|
|[Breast Cancer Tumor Prediction](https://github.com/annabellejkanch/BreastCancerTumorPrediction) |Python, SQL|${{\color{Green}\{\textsf{  Topic: Tumor Prediction \ \}}}}\$ &rarr; Multi Layer Perceptron model for breast cancer diagnosis, model contains 8 hidden layers with dropout and L2 regularization. The dataset preprocessed fro optimal performance and the model achieved a validation accuracy of 98%. A web application was then built to enable real-time tumor classification based user-input data. |Oct 2024 - Dec 2024|
|[Comparison of Style Transfer Methods]() | Python |${{\color{Green}\{\textsf{  Topic: Style Transfer \ \}}}}\$ &rarr; This project compares the classical Neural Style Transfer method proposed by Gatys et al. with the AdaIN method proposed by Huang et al., using VGG-19 for feature extraction. I developed the NST model and referred to Huang's Lua implementation of AdaIN to develop it in Python. The project evaluates their differences in style fusion, efficiency, and output quality using metrics like content loss, style loss, and FID scores.| Sept 2024 - Dec 2024 |

|‚öïÔ∏è [Medical Insurance Cost Dashboard](https://github.com/annabellekanch/MicrosoftPowerBI/blob/main/Medical%20Insurance%20Cost%20Dashboard/ReadMe.md) | Excel, PowerBI  | ${{\color{Purple}\{\textsf{Topic: Healthcare, Multiple Linear Regression\ \}}}}\$ <br>For this dashboard I cleaned my data in Excel and used functions like *VLOOKUP() and INDEXMATCH()* to ensure data quality. I created 5 dashboard visualizations. A bar graph visualizing the total cost of insurance by region, two line charts visualizing the avg cost of insurance by age and avg. cost of insurance by BMI, a simple linear regression model using *LINEST()* to calculate the linear regression line between age and cost of medical insurance, and a multiple linear regression model to calculate the cost of medical insurance based on BMI, number of children the client has, the client's gender, and if the client is a smoker.     |  [Dashboard]()
