| üí° [MISO Hourly Load Data Analysis for 2018 - 2023]() | Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn,   |${{\color{Bittersweet}\{\textsf{Topic: Time Series Analysis\ \}}}}\$ <br>  In analysis, I analyzed the hourly load data for the Midcontinent Independent System Operator using the ARIMA method. The objective of this analysis was to predict the hourly load data for the next 24 hours.                |

# Data Visualizations

> [!NOTE]  
> All dashboards links are (re)made in Tableau, this is purely because Tableau allows for free, universal access; unlike Power BI. In order to view the Power BI Dashboard, click on the Project Name link. It will take you to the Github repository where the PBIX file is kept, you can then download and open the file in Power BI Desktop

|‚öïÔ∏è [Medical Insurance Cost Dashboard](https://github.com/annabellekanch/MicrosoftPowerBI/blob/main/Medical%20Insurance%20Cost%20Dashboard/ReadMe.md) | Excel, PowerBI  | ${{\color{Bittersweet}\{\textsf{Topic: Healthcare, Multiple Linear Regression\ \}}}}\$ <br>For this dashboard I cleaned my data in Excel and used functions like *VLOOKUP() and INDEXMATCH()* to ensure data quality. I created 5 dashboard visualizations. A bar graph visualizing the total cost of insurance by region, two line charts visualizing the avg cost of insurance by age and avg. cost of insurance by BMI, a simple linear regression model using *LINEST()* to calculate the linear regression line between age and cost of medical insurance, and a multiple linear regression model to calculate the cost of medical insurance based on BMI, number of children the client has, the client's gender, and if the client is a smoker.     |  [Dashboard]()
